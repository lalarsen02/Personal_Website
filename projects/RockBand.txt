Description:
I started my computer science journey in the fall of 2021. In the first half of my sophomore year, I took "Computer Science: An Interdisciplinary Approach," which served as my introduction to the field. The course taught basic computer science principles and issues while utilizing diverse areas of study, from science-related fields like physics, chemistry, and biology to humanities-related domains like linguistics and music. This course sparked my passion for computer science - the way it bridged seemingly unrelated disciplines to solve complex problems fascinated me and inspired me to explore the endless possibilities of this field. 

This was the course's final project, where I developed a fully functioning command-line DAW (Digital Audio Workstation) for music production. It was built upon a prior assignment titled "Guitar Hero," where I implemented the Karplus-Strong algorithm to simulate the sound of a plucked guitar string. Building on this, I included instruments like bass strings, a synthesizer, and various drum sounds. Beyond instrument simulation, I incorporated a recording and playback system utilizing a symbol table so users could seamlessly play what they created at any time. Finally, I added the capability to manipulate the audio with effects, like reversing the audio, adding delay and reverb, and applying distortion.

In several respects, however, the program faced significant limitations born out of inexperience. For instance, I had yet to figure out how to incorporate a metronome during recording sessions, leaving users without a crucial tool for maintaining rhythm. Furthermore, certain aspects of the software were inefficient, which resulted in high latency. This delay meant there was a noticeable lag between the moment the user pressed a key and when they actually heard the corresponding sound, detracting from the overall experience. 

Despite these limitations, this project not only marked the culmination of my first steps into computer science but also solidified my passion for combining creativity with technical problem-solving. By exploring the intersection of music and computer science, I was instilled with a deep appreciation for the transformative power of technology. I was motivated to pursue my studies further and explore new innovative ways to merge creativity with coding.
