Title: The Great Princeton Raccoon Invasion

Description:
"The Great Princeton Raccoon Invasion" was a game built with three.js where the player plays as a golf cart that is supposed to run over as many raccoons as possible before too many students are killed. This game was conceived due to a raccoon attack on campus. It was designed as a final project for "Computer Graphics" with two other classmates: Everett Shen and Ilay Furman. 

The game offers immersive physics, having dynamic gameplay with responsive controls, spatial sounds, and a third-person camera. Students and raccoons are modeled with animations and follow distinct behaviors that challenge players to navigate a campus-inspired map while managing collisions and boundaries. The game achieved smooth performance and engaging mechanics, including a fine-tuned difficulty system and acceleration/deceleration triggered by the player's actions. We also added a display with the score and controls for a better user experience. 

Overall, this was my first exploration into game development. I gained hands-on experience with 3D modeling, physics engines, and collision detection while also learning how to balance gameplay mechanics for both performance and player engagement. Within the team, I was responsible for creating the map and writing code for collisions. This was a challenge because this was my first time using Blender, the primary tool for creating the map. I'm excited to build upon this game, potentially improving the graphics or adding a multiplayer mode.
